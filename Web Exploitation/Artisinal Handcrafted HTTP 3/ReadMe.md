Name: Artisinal Handcrafted HTTP 3
Score: 300
Description: We found a hidden flag server hiding behind a proxy, but the proxy has some... _interesting_ ideas of what qualifies someone to make HTTP requests.  Looks like you'll have to do this one by hand.  Try connecting via <code>nc 2018shell1.picoctf.com 42496</code>, and use the proxy to send HTTP requests to `flag.local`.  We've also recovered a username and a password for you to use on the login page: `realbusinessuser`/`potoooooooo`.
