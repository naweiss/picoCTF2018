There are four functions in main.

header: 	Useless garbage
set_timer:	Trigger exit after 3 second
get_key:	Function that creates a key using calculate_key
print_flag:	Function that calls decrypt_flag with the key and prints the decrypted flag

The key is set to be the 1015 value of fibonacci (from 0).
The problem is that this number is calculated using recursion (sloooow).
The executable exits after 3 seconds :< too fast to print the decrypted flag.

So the key is 3611214637 (see the file be-quick-or-be-dead-2.c for details).

We can patch the program to return this value.
Or, as I did, disable the timer ("handle SIGALRM ignore" in gdb)
	and manually skip the function call and set the returned value.
