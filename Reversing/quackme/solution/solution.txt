The executable calls do_magic which reads a string 
	and xors every character of it with constant values (sekrutBuffer).
	
Then it checks if the result is the greeting message:

"You have now entered the Duck Web, and you're in for a honkin' good time.
Can you figure out my trick?"

The length of sekrutBuffer is 25 so the password is the same length.
We can xor the greeting message with sekrutBuffer to find what the input must be.
