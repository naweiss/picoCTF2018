There are four functions in main.

header: 	Useless garbage
set_timer:	Trigger exit after 1 second
get_key:	Function that creates a key using calculate_key
print_flag:	Function that calls decrypt_flag with the key and prints the decrypted flag

The executable exits after a second :< too fast to print the decrypted flag.

We can run the executable via gdb and disable the timer using:
(gdb) handle SIGALRM ignore

Now the flag is printed
