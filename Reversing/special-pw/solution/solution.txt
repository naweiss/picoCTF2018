I compiled the assembly using pwntools with the script compile.py
	for easier reversing.

You can see in the assembly code that loops on the content of argv
	XOR it with argv[1] and preforms rotations on some adjacent bytes.
The answer then compared with some data string.
	
The script solve.py contains the same encryption code and deception code 
	that does the opposite and prints the flag.
