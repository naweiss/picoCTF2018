The given python code read the given map file and calculate series of values passed into logic gates.
Every value is stored in the array and can be used as input to another gate.
At the end the some gate value is calculated and compared to true.
The first inputs are given by the key binary digits and the other ones are inputs from previous gates.

Given a map we must find a key that results true as the output of the system.
We can use z3 (SAT solver) to declare all the constrains and find input the satisfies them.

Look at solve.py to see how it's done.
