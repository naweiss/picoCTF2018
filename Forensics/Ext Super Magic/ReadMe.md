Name: Ext Super Magic
Score: 250
Description: We salvaged a ruined Ext SuperMagic II-class mech recently and pulled the <a href='//2018shell1.picoctf.com/static/216c0a3d1c6517055035a3a95b78d9fe/ext-super-magic.img'>filesystem</a> out of the black box.  It looks a bit corrupted, but maybe there's something interesting in there. You can also find it in /problems/ext-super-magic_4_f196e59a80c3fdac37cc2f331692ef13 on the shell server.
