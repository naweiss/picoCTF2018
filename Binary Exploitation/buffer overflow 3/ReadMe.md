Name: buffer overflow 3
Score: 450
Description: It looks like Dr. Xernon added a stack canary to this <a href='//2018shell1.picoctf.com/static/ce00c0f7dc9cb4ddf31fbee32962841e/vuln'>program</a> to protect against buffer overflows. Do you think you can bypass the protection and get the flag? You can find it in /problems/buffer-overflow-3_3_6bcc2aa22b2b7a4a7e3ca6b2e1194faf. <a href='//2018shell1.picoctf.com/static/ce00c0f7dc9cb4ddf31fbee32962841e/vuln.c'>Source</a>.
