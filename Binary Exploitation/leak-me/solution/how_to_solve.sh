# This is manual solution
# Run:
	(python -c "print('a'*256)"; cat) | ../auth
# If you have 64-bit system and you can't run 32-bit files add "qemu-i386" before "../auth"

# Then you will ses the password after the comma:

# Explanation:
#	The program reads password with max length of 256.
#	The program also replaces the trailing new-line character with NULL.
#	So if we will type exactly 256 characters the new-line will not be read into the buffer
#		and no NULL character will be at the end of the string.
#	So, when the name is printed every thing after it (the flag) will be
#		printed as well until NULL character
