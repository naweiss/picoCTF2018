The program gives us two options (exit is not an option ;) )
1 - Buy useless thing: Costs 1000$, we can buy any number of this item 
		as long as we have the money for it.
2 - Buy the real flag: We must pay 100000$ but we start with 1100 :<

There is integer overflow in the first option.
For example, if we will buy MAX_INT-500 (2147483147) items
	it will cost us 2147483147000$ but MAX_INT is 2147483147
	so it will become -501000$ and will will gain 501000$.

Now we can buy the actual flag.

Note: the flag is embedded in the binary 
	so we can use the string command to find the flag
